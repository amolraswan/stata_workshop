# Session 3

I would recommend reviewing the material on macros and loops from session 2. There are a few advanced topics to discuss within these, but we will come back to them later. Use this break to re-attempt session 2's assignment!

We will finish our project directory discussion by looking at a sample do-file system. We will quickly move on to the ``by`` (``bysort``) command but that journey will first take us through a few smaller things like ``_n``, ``_N``, and ``duplicates`` and ``sort`` commands.
