# Session 2

We will do a quick recap of the Stata window and do-file editor. Session 1's [introduction to Stata](https://amolraswan.github.io/stata_workshop/session1/1_short_intro_stata/) has two links at the end which I would encourage you to refer to as refresher videos. Since they cover most of what I'll actually highlight in the session, I am not going to post any notes related to the recap. 

We have two learning objectives for today:

1. How to set up a project folder and how best to set up your do-files.
2. Part b of question 1 was perhaps the most annoying question on session 1's [assignment](https://amolraswan.github.io/stata_workshop/session1/4_assignment/). Given what we had learnt in session 1, this question required you to be repetitive for different months and variables. We will learn how to code for such tasks more efficiently.

Though these two objectives appear disparate, they are closely related because to accomplish them both, we will learn what global and local macros are.
