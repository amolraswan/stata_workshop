    "As a data RA, you might start working on a project when the data collection is just beginning or when it has been completed. In the former case, the project staff often require help program or bench-test the survey during the design stage (if using computer-assisted interviewing), and to conduct high frequency checks or back checks during the implementation stage. In the latter case, data RAs are principally responsible for the cleaning and analysis of the data.\n",
