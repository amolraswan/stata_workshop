This is an in-progress Stata tutorial for beginners.

Important to warn you that this is not the most holistic resource on Stata. It has been designed to function as a tutorial with exercises. I have sincerely attempted to not bog down it with too much detail and instead, the content evolves over time as it would in a classroom setting. That said, in the next few weeks, I will add links to command-specific pages for the deep-divers. 

Another Stata tutorial I would whole-heartedly recommend is [IPA's Stata Training](https://github.com/PovertyAction/IPA-Stata-Trainings). It is hands-down the most excellent publicly-available resource. You can download the zipped folder from the linked page and then go through the tutorial on your computer. 

In the end, you will not learn Stata through tutorials (AHA!). Yes, learning basic commands is helpful but you need to get into the weeds by starting a Stata project. This is the reason behind the short assignments in sessions 1-3 and (upcoming) projects in sessions 4-5. 

What I say in this tutorial may also often be incorrect. Please email at amolraswan@gmail.com with any errors or your suggestions. Thank you :)
