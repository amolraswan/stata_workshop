# Session 4

We will focus on variable management and combining datasets. 

We will review variable types, variable labels, and value labels. The latter two may be better put under dataset documentation but the exact classification is not particularly important here. 

Combining can take two forms: appending and merging - depending on whether we want to add observations (rows) or variables (columns), respectively.
